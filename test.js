let teststr = `As immortal beings, most injuries have little significance to vampires due to their intense regeneration skills. While the speed depends on the vampire, almost any injury can be healed within minutes. If a body part becomes decapitated, it will evaporate and begin to grow back from where it was cut off. In addition, application of vampire blood or saliva can
also heal wounds on humans. Seishirou Shishirui the first minion of Kissshot was able to regenerate from nothingness after his failed attempt at suicide by jumping in front of sunlight
albeit it took him several centuries to recover fully so Koyomi being Kissshot\\'s second minion should have comparable regeneration. Like other vampires, Koyomi will burn up in sunlight. This is painful, but since his regeneration is so strong he can\'t die from it. Koyomi\\'s regenerative powers are so strong he\\'s perfectly fine if his body is actively burning. His pulverized arm heals instantaneously. Instantly regenerates his hands after they were chopped off. Gives himself impromptu brain surgery with his bare hand. Revives Hanekawa from death with his blood. Instantly regenerates from having his head destroyed. Seishirou Shishirui was able to regenerate completely from just a severed piece of his hand. Kissshot regenerated and flew back to Antarctica after 3/4 of her body was destroyed. Koyomi should have comparable regeneration to both of them also even if he is disintegrated he can literally regenerate from just his ashes. However, this takes time and is thus not applicable for combat.`
