The Mixcoatl is made of wood, cloth, and obsidian. It resembles two 5 meters canoes with one placed on top of the other. Four wings are positioned underneath it. The craft is specialized in sea battles, being capable of hovering and gliding at high speeds over the ocean surface like a flying fish, using its multiple wings to keep itself steady. Return of the Winged One apparently also has tiny one-man reconnaissance models of the Mixcoatl.",

As his name implies, he is the actual Big Bad Wolf seen and read in the fairy tales. Bigby Wolf was originally born from a she-wolf named Winter and the deity known as the North Wind. After a brief Romance, North left Winter, who soon fell ill and gave birth to a litter of seven cubs. One of them was Bigby, who was ostracized by his brothers for being small and weak. His mother soon died, and his brothers left him, but Bigby who had nowhere else to go, stayed with his mother's dead corpse. He failed to protect his mother's poor body from scavengers due to his weak nature, and from then on he made a vow to make himself bigger and stronger. He hunted beasts of various sizes as he grew up, moving from one fearsome monster to another bigger monster. He learned his powers to summon the win while hunting the Three Little Pigs, and after an unsuccessful attempt to eat Red Riding Hood started his targeting of humans as prey.",

In his first appearance, Sun is shown to be fun-loving and mischievous, with little regard for the law - stowing away on a ship, thanking the crew for the ride during his escape, throwing a banana peel in a detective's face, and stealing apples. He has a lot of self-confidence, referring to himself as a \"great stowaway.\" He is also a bit of a flirt towards Blake. In conversation, Sun is very laid-back and casual. He is also kind and patient, willing to listen to Blake's story and waiting for her to do so for nearly two days, bearing with her \"small talk and weird looks.\" He is not afraid to give his opinion and has a dislike for those who regard themselves as \"holier than thou,\" or who \"use force to get whatever they want\", such as the White Fang. Sun also seems to be willing to help others, regardless of whether he is asked or not, even if he barely knows them. This quality is further demonstrated when he readily volunteers to help Team RWBY with their investigation, despite both Blake and Ruby stating their opposition to his involvement.",

While the concept makes any full power attack infinite, if a weapon suppresses its power output from being maximum it will only get a fraction of that effect. As such it can then easily be overpowered by any other weapon in the concept space.\n"

That means if the user thinks of not getting hit, the attack won't hit them. If the user thinks of shooting energy beams from their hands, energy beams will shoot form their hands. If the user thinks that the opponent will loose, then the opponent will loose. This has only two weaknesses. First that the user can only think of one thing at a time and second that their expectations can be met in unexpected ways. E.g. Expecting the opponent to loose can be countered by the opponent loosing in something other than the fight.\n"

It premiered on Cartoon Network on January 4, 1999.

Under the unofficial leadership of Eddy, the trio constantly invent schemes to make money from their peers to purchase their favorite confectionery, jawbreakers. Their plans usually fail though, leaving them in various, often humiliating, predicaments",

After creating a stick figure named the Victim/Chosen One/Second Coming, things start to go out of hand. Refusing the animator's commands, the Victim/Chosen One/Second Coming goes on a rampage, wreaking havoc onto Alan's programs and potentially destroying his computer. To liberate his hardware's security, Alan has to finish what he started by putting an end to the Victim/Chosen One/Second Coming's existence once and for all.",

We both seek the girl... although for different reasons. This new world has incredible potential... it is freshly born, still forming, begging to be crafted by the hands of the new God. I AM that God. With her powers I can mould this world to my vision. All I need is your cooperation, your obeisance. And in return I offer eternal peace, true freedom. Disobey me and you will find that I am a wrathful God. Those who oppose me are cleansed in the fires of my guiding light. They become my acolytes, my disciples. Doomed to burn forever. I am Father Theodore and I am here to purge the world of sin..."

Over the following decades after such event, knowledge of the Runes began to spread as more were unearthed. The world’s brightest minds studied the ancient glyphs, attempting to determine the powers they possessed. Few could even begin to understand the importance of their origins, or the sheer power held within them. Some surmised that the Runes were integral to the creation of Runeterra itself. The first use of these mysterious artifacts proved catastrophic, as they reshaped the landscape of entire nations. Mistrust quickly grew as those who knew of the Runes imagined such “Makers’ Might” being used as a weapon. Conflicts later related to these magical artifacts were known as the Rune Wars.",

As its name would imply, it grants MegaMan access to a variety of powers wielded by his rival, Bass.EXE. Along with incredible speed and strength that surpasses anything the Navis were capable of their own, MegaMan is granted access to Bass's devastating and nigh-undodgeable Buster Rake, Hell's Rolling, and Darkness Overload attacks (the latter of which is especially notable due to being the single most powerful achievable attack in the entire series) along with Bass's levitation ability, allowing him to easily overpower Nebula Grey in the movie. The golden version seems to focus more on raw physical ability in the movie while the silver version prioritizes Bass's special attacks. However, it has been stated that no single body should be able to contain the power of two Ultimate Programs, rendering the transformation unstable and nearly deleting both Navis by the battle's end.",

He is only able to use it for a limited time though, exhausting him physically and emotionally in the process of keeping the Cybeast locked away. If invoked once again while exhausted he loses control and enters a state called Beast Over, rendering him invincible and uncontrollable while remaining able to use any Battle Chips inserted prior to activation.

Focusing his Cosmos within his right fist, he releases a great quantity of his power in the form of many Beams of Cosmic Energy.

However, as his control of Cosmos and speed increased, so did the number of Meteors / Shooting Stars, being around 100 Million to 1 Billion at Faster than Light Speeds, and likely Hundreds of Trillions in his most powerful forms.",

Originally created by Umbrella scientists as result of experimentation, they would rarely be seen in action up until 1998, the year the first viral outbreak was caused deliberately by former Umbrella scientist James Marcus, resulting in the infection of most of Umbrella's employees located in the Arklay Mountains. The actions of the now infected would lead to the intervention of S.T.A.R.S. police force which resulted in the Ecliptic Express and Mansion Incidents, where several members of the team would be brutally murdered by the infected.",

Using the surrounding geography like the buildings in Jaya's square, he bounces from one spot to the next, increasing in speed with each successive spring, while also disorientating opponents with the continuous sound of springing. He keeps increasing his speed to such a level that he seemingly disappears to spectators. Then he simply has to aim himself fist first at the target and let the accumulated momentum do the rest. This is the technique Bellamy used to defeat Roshio, which caused a good deal of collateral damage on the surfaces he bounced off of, and was first properly seen when he battled against Luffy, the latter of whom possessed enough reflex and insight to keep up with Bellamy's increasing speed and completely nullified the Spring Hopper by punching Bellamy right in the head. After the time-skip, Bellamy combined this with Busoshoku Haki, managing to strike Luffy, who was too restricted by his emotions to counterattack like two years ago.",

Such a remarkable ability makes her tricky to defeat, considering that, if the opponent doesn't manage to strike her down in a single blow, Sherria can heal herself and continue battling as if nothing happened. This skill can also be applied to others, as shown from Sherria healing Wendy's wounds after their battle, doing so through a halo of light generated around her open palms. The fact that Sherria couldn't completely heal Lucy Heartfilia after the latter was brutalized by Minerva, however, hints at certain limitations on the young God Slayer's powers.

Black air is then generated from her very arms, appearing in the form of stylized feathers, which rapidly grow in numbers until Sherria condenses them into an elongated mass before her with her hands. Such final current grows larger and larger as one of its ending parts wraps around her body and the other is fired towards the target. Four heavenly wings composed of black air are shown protruding from the part focused around Sherria's body, while the entire structure is surrounded by thin, spiraling currents of the very same wind, scattering some of the feathers around as the dark, serpentine mass approaches its target at high speed. While Heavenly Gathering of Clouds' effects are currently unknown due to Wendy Marvell, the targeted opponent, having made Sherria miss through a peculiar use of her own healing Magic, the girl's comrades were alarmed at her use of it, sure that she would have killed her target, and Mages the likes of Jellal Fernandes and Erza Scarlet were astounded by such spell's sheer Magic Power.",

Despite this, she is brave and will stand up to face an opponent without a problem. She claims her \"love\" isn't at the level of her cousin yet.

This Critical Edge is very effective as it leaves the enemy vulnerable to numerous air combos and can be used to finish or extend a combo. Additionally, Natsu can quickly shift into her \"Possession\" stance during this attack, which can cause danger to the opponent even if it is blocked. The downside to this Critical Edge, however, is that it can be easily evaded by the \"Quick Step\" tactic if the enemy is prepared, leaving Natsu open for attack.",

This creature is more focused on its psionic power rather than its physical form, though it is not frail. Its psionic abilities come from its design favoring its Protoss half over its Zerg half. With incredible psionic abilities, a massive, glowing form, and radiating energy, a Hybrid Destroyer is one of the most dangerous creatures in the StarCraft universe.",

Is it when you comprehend how small you are, compared to the vastness of what threatens to destroy you? When did you learn that the journey isn't a lonely road, that you didn't have to face the darkness alone? Lesser souls lose heart, and lay down their swords, but a champion risks everything for the greater good. Take comfort in this. True heroes never die. The sun rises, the sun sets, but we all have to cross the river someday... even her."

One day, when she was 13, her Planeswalker spark awakened violently as she destroyed her warden with powerful magic and instinctively planeswalked away to unknown planes for many years before arriving on Bant. On Band, Elspeth's life would finally have some stability, with her experiencing for the first time things like companionship, love, community, and peace. She became a squire at age 17 and became a full knight only 3 years later. However, this high time in her life would be fleeting, as the Conflux soon took place, with the forces of Nicol Bolas advancing on her plane. While she ultimately repelled the enemy and killed Malfegor, she began to feel that Bant was no home for her and planeswalked away, never to return.",

During a war between the east and west, Seda and his forces were on the brink of defeat when a dark lord approached Seda and offered him power in exchange for allowing the dark lord to mix Seda's blood with that of a witch's. Seda accepted the offer and after destroying the armies of the west, returned to his kingdom. Their, tragedy struck and Seda lost his wife Sophia. Thanks to the witch's blood running through his vains, Seda's hate manifested into a being of pure negative energy known as the Dark Genie. After losing everything and nearly giving up, he found about the Atlamillia stone. Believing it to possess the power to stop the Dark Genie, Seda used a forbidden spell to travel to the future in order to obtain the stone and seal the Genie.",

Faris is a pirate captain who travels with a pirate ship and its crew, accompanied by a sea-dragon named Syldra. The party first encounters Faris when they try to steal the pirate ship, which leads to their adventures as the Warriors of Light. Faris eventually lets the party use their ship, which can move without wind due to Faris' sea creature friend, Syldra, moving it. Faris is chosen by the Fire Crystal, symbolizing courage. It is revealed quickly that Faris is in fact a girl and Lenna's long lost sister Sarisa.",
